In this tutorial , we will discuss how we can make our debian machine as a router, provided our machine has alteast two network interfaces. We will demonstrate this using virtual machine.

create a virtual machine
setup two network interfaces on it.
        one as bridged adapter—for accessing working network
        one as internal network–for our local network
    power on the machine and connect the first interface
        apt-get install net-tools   (for ifconfig)
    set up second interface as
        edit /etc/network/interfaces as
        auto enp0s8
        iface enp0s8 inet static
            address 192.168.7.1
            netmask 255.255.255.0
            gateway 192.168.7.1
            network 192.168.7.0
        service networking restart—eventhough fail message try ifconfig
        The new interface is assigned an ip address on this network
    configure dnsmasq
        dnsmasq provides both dns and dhcp functionality
        apt-get install dnsmasq.
        /etc/dnsmasq.conf
        interface=enp0s8  —-interface on which dhcp server should listen
        dhcp-range  192.168.7.50, 192.168.7.150,12h—-beg,end,lease valid time
        service dnsmasq restart.
    setup client
        create another virtual machine with one interface
        set interface to local network
        power on the machine
        connect to network and check the ip you got.
        dns server is set as the router …which copies from 8.8.8.8
        client can now connect to any machine in local network , that we created.
        but not to external network.
    Enable ip forwarding in router from one interface to another
        echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        iptables –table nat –append POSTROUTING –out-interface enp0s3 -j MASQUERADE
        //specifies translate the address from which the request from local network comes to the router address–after routing to interface enp0s3—masquerading
        iptables –append FORWARD –in-interface enp0s8 -j ACCEPT
        //accept all request from interface enp0s8 and forward it.
        service networking restart to reflect the changes
    go to localmachin
        ping 192.168.7.1
        ping 192.168.1.1
        ping google.com
        access the network
